# PWA Icon Placeholders

This directory contains placeholder files representing the PWA icons.

In a production environment, you would replace these with actual PNG icon files:

- icon-72x72.png
- icon-96x96.png  
- icon-128x128.png
- icon-144x144.png
- icon-152x152.png
- icon-192x192.png
- icon-384x384.png
- icon-512x512.png

These icons are referenced in the manifest.json file and are used for:
- App icon on home screen when installed
- Splash screen display
- Browser tab favicon
- Various system UI contexts

Icon design should follow PWA best practices:
- Simple, recognizable design that works at small sizes
- High contrast for visibility
- Consistent with app branding
- Maskable icon support for Android adaptive icons
